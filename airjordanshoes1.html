Jason Day championed the sought after <a href="http://www.nikeunion.com">Air Jordan 1</a> Golf exclusive earlier today during the British Open Championship. While they weren’t traditional ‘Chicago’ colors like the pair that released in limited numbers, they definitely created quite the buzz on the Twitter. Golf lovers didn’t find them traditional enough and took to roasting Day, but we love that the Nike sponsored athlete took the risk of wearing Mike’s first pair in golf shoe form. Check out some of Twitter’s responses to his on-feet selection and in related news, be sure to stay tuned for the coming Air Jordan 1 Flyknit set to release later this year.
